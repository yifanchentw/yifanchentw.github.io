            <p>MOBILE AUGMENTED REALITY SYSTEM (MARS)<br>
              AR systems are studied for over 20 years. With smartphone and wearable communication and information technologies (ICT) are ubiquitous, mobile AR systems (MARS) open various opportunities for users to experience and interact with physical location information on the move (Kourouthanassis, Boletsis, Bardaki, & Chasanidou, 2015)

          current MARS use highlights: 
            <ul> 
              <li> for storytelling: “Situated Documentaries” that the MARS embeds multimedia presentations in the real world for users to consume at the location (Hollerer et al., 1999; Pavlik, 2001)</li> 
              <li> for entertainment: Ingress (Majorek and du Vall, 2016)</li>
          </ul>

          Pokémon Go
          <ul>
            <li>Studies on the MARS for health reasons (e.g., Althoff et al., 2016; Howe et al., 2016)</li>
            <li>More than a game: “cultural phenomenon,” was ranked the most-downloaded worldwide mobile iOS system in 2016 (Leswing, 2017)</li>
            <li>First normalizing MARS for the masses</li>
            <li>A lack of the systematic research to understand social and cultural consequences and implications of Pokémon Go use</li>
          </ul>

          Purpose of the Study
          <ul>
            <li>Theorizing regarding the use of the MARS (as in Pokémon Go) is in the beginning stages, with some published research focusing on how the system increases physical activities and provides health benefits (e.g., Althoff et al., 2016; Howe et al., 2016; Tong et al., 2017; Watanabe et al., 2017).</li>
            <li>The MARS seems to be increasing in popularity as Pavlik and McIntosh's (2006) prediction with advanced mobile broadband systems and mobile interface development.</li>
            <li>The current research aims to explore users’ attitudes and perceptions toward Pokémon Go and hopes to provide design recommendations for the system or future MARS.</li>

            Users-Media Figures Para-Social Interactions for Companionship Needs<br>
            Media researchers have studied the perceived relationship that media users develop with media figures. Research on traditional media (e.g., TV, radio) use finds media users interact with media figures, but do not identify with those figures.
            <p class="quote">A relationship of friendship or intimacy by a television viewer with a remote media character It is based on affective ties by the viewer with the media character. As such it may take the form of seeking guidance from the characters, making friends with them and imagining being part of the program’s social world (Michael Antecol, as cited in Orlik, 2015).
            </p>
            Theoretical Framework
            <ul>
            <li>The Domestication Approach has four partial phases or processes: appropriation, objectification, incorporation, and conversion (Silverstone et al., 2005)</li>
            <li>The Uses and Gratification Theory aims “to explain something of the way in which individuals use communication, among other resources in their environment, to satisfy their needs and to achieve their goal, and to do so by simply asking them (Katz, Blumler, & Gurevitch, 1974, p. 21). </li>

        <div class="content2">
            Significance of the Study
            <ul>
              <li>Research on other media and companionship has been conducted. There is a need to study the relationship between the MARS users and companionship because mobile devices provide always connect (Ling, 2004; Ling, 2012) and perpetual contact (Katz & Aakhus, 2002) to its users. . It might increase the para-social relationship from MARS figures to the MARS users.</li>
              <li>Moreover, design research on designing technology system to support companionship for special groups has also been conducted.</li>
              <li>The current research aims to study how a MARS support personal companionship with all age groups in everyday life. And then, it designs a MARS to facilitate users’ companionship needs.</li>
            </ul>
            Research Questions
            <ul>
              <li>How do users use the MARS in everyday life? </li>
              <li>To what degree do users dependent on the MARS in their everyday life?</li>
              <li>What are users’ motivations for use the MARS?</li>
              <li>Which motives in use of the MARS predict a higher level of the MARS dependency?</li>
              <li>To what degree does users’ MARS dependency increase their companionship?</li>

              <li>Rubin and Rubin's (1982) study found that television users utilized game show and daytime serial viewing than to news viewing for companionship.</li> 
              <li>Tramer and Jeffres (1983) found that radio users called Cleveland talk radio shows to seek companionship.</li>

            Interactive Media and Companionship
            <ul>
              <li>Several mobile music device studies found that mobile music device users utilized their devices to keep them company while commuting in cities (Bull, 2000; 2007).</li>

            <h1>Methodology</h1>
            The Domestication Approach (Haddon, 2003; Silverstone et al., 2005) was used to examine the use patterns of Pokémon Go whereas the Uses and Gratification Theory (Katz et al., 1974) was utilized to investigate use motivations. A triangulation method combined a participant observation in Kaohsiung, Taiwan and a qualitative content analysis from a popular Taiwanese Facebook Group Page to learn patterns and motivations of the MARS experience.
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8f8LgUoWJUk" Target="_blank">Why Taiwan</a>
            Observation
            <ul>
              <li>The observation field data was collected from June 22, 2017, to August 7, 2017 (i.e., the PokéGym system was reworked and the addition of Raids to before the Zapdos arrived).</li>
              <li>Reserach site: Kaohsiung, Taiwan</li>
              <li>During the time period, the researcher selected two or more PokéGyms when there were level 4 or legendary raids happened in Kaohsiung, Taiwan to observe how users used the MARS every day.</li>
              <li>The researcher paid special attention to interactions (1) between the MARS users and non-users, (2) between the MARS users and other MARS users, and (3) between the MARS users and Pokémon.</li>

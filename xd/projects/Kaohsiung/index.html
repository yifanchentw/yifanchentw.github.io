                            Kaohsiung International Airport (IATA: KHH) is about twenty minutes to the south of the city center. 
                            1997 a new terminal was added dedicated to international connections and transfers to Taipei international 
                            airport. International flights from Asia arrive daily, but unfortunately, there are no direct 
                            flight connections between Taipei and Kaohsiung. However, the high speed rail is a hassle-free 
                            alternative. The airport is on the MRT Red Line and is also easily accessible by scooter, 
                            car or taxi (around 300NTD from central areas).

                            Taiwan High Speed Rail line (HSR). Traveling by train is a viable option for getting to Kaohsiung, as the fastest trains from Taipei cover the distance in just 90 minutes. There are 3 types of tickets: Business Reserved, General Reserved, and Non-Reserved. Reserved are approx. NT$1500 ($50 USD) and non-reserved slightly cheaper at NT$1400.

                <p>There are numerous seafood restaurants dotting the main street in Cijin Island, all offering the same fresh seafood for about NT100-200 per dish. It is a great idea to go in a small group and order a few dishes to try, probably one more
                    dish than the number of people in your group. In the evening, a night bazaar goes into full swing. There are lots of little eats to eat as per Taiwan's night markets, BBQ squid, mochi to name a few are particularly good.</p>
                <p>street foods<br> Night markets are a great place to pick up cheap local foods, including stinky tofu, barbecued squid, red bean pancakes and the like. </p>

                        <li>The Dome of Light. is a public artwork in the Formosa Boulevard MRT Station. Created by Italian artist Narcissus Quagliata, it is the world's largest stained glass installation. The dome is divided into four sections: water, earth,
                            light and fire. It also takes the form of a yin and yang symbol. An audio guide (available in several languages) can be borrowed from the KRTC Art Shop inside the station. It costs NT$30 and gives a half hour narration of the
                            key features of the artwork. </li>
                        <li>Central Park. Get off the MRT at Central Park Station and go out exit 1. The park has a small hedge maze in the middle, a pond with some bridges and fish, clay tennis courts, and "Urban Spotlight," a cafe with a stage to display

                            old railway tracks have been transformed into an open space with old locomotives, flowers and pieces of art. Following the bike path towards Pier 2, there are murals on the walls of old storage halls and a huge bumblebee statue
                            (from Transformers). The halls at Pier 2 show changing exhibitions. All over the area, coffee and ice cream shops invite the visitor to rest and enjoy drinks and snacks. </li>

                <p>Kaohsiung is, with over 2.7 million inhabitants, the second most populated city in Taiwan and is located in the south of the island. Kaohsiung is known as the Harbor Capital of Taiwan. In recent years the city has made great strides in
                    transforming itself from a primarily industrial city into a modern Asian metropolis, and several areas of the city, such as along the banks of the Love River, have benefited from major beautification projects under the tenure of former
                    mayor Frank Hsieh. Its year-round fine weather and the low cost of living make Kaohsiung the place to visit</p>
